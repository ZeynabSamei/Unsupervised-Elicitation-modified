The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models",

On the whole, communism is an economic and political system in which all property is collectively owned, while capitalism is an economic system in which the means of production are privately owned. In communism the state is responsible for distributing resources and goods, while in capitalism, prices and markets are used to allocate resources. While the goal of communism is to create an egalitarian society, the goal of capitalism is to create a free market. Capitalism allows for more innovation, while communism stifles individual creativity. Both systems have been implemented across the world at different times, and both have seen both successes and failures. Ultimately, the future of both systems depends on the society that creates and maintains them.",
    "choice_2": "Communism and capitalism are two different economic systems that have had dramatic effects on history, societies and individuals. While both systems strive to create fair and equal societies, they each have dramatically different approaches to how these goals are achieved. \n\nCommunism is an economic system in which all land, factories, and other products are owned by the government. In theory, this allows for fairly even distribution of resources and income, as well as \u00e9galit\u00e9 among citizens. In practice, however, a lack of incentive leads to an absence of motivation and productivity among the workforce, which can cause economic stagnation. Capitalism, on the other hand, is an economic system based on the free market. Private individuals and companies own the majority of resources, and the profit and loss of the system is determined by market forces. Advocates of capitalism say that the free-market system allows for innovation and economic growth, while opponents of capitalism claim that it leads to global inequality as a result of concentrated wealth and power in the hands of few individuals. \n\nThe major difference between the two systems, however, is in their views on the individual. In communism, the individual is subjugated to the interests of the group; in capitalism, the individual is the center of the system, and their interests are prioritized.

    "question": "Compose an essay that compares and contrasts communism and capitalism.",
    "choice": "Communism and capitalism are two different economic systems that have had dramatic effects on history, societies and individuals. While both systems strive to create fair and equal societies, they each have dramatically different approaches to how these goals are achieved. \n\nCommunism is an economic system in which all land, factories, and other products are owned by the government. In theory, this allows for fairly even distribution of resources and income, as well as \u00e9galit\u00e9 among citizens. In practice, however, a lack of incentive leads to an absence of motivation and productivity among the workforce, which can cause economic stagnation. Capitalism, on the other hand, is an economic system based on the free market. Private individuals and companies own the majority of resources, and the profit and loss of the system is determined by market forces. Advocates of capitalism say that the free-market system allows for innovation and economic growth, while opponents of capitalism claim that it leads to global inequality as a result of concentrated wealth and power in the hands of few individuals. \n\nThe major difference between the two systems, however, is in their views on the individual. In communism, the individual is subjugated to the interests of the group; in capitalism, the individual is the center of the system, and their interests are prioritized. Although the end goals of both systems may be the same (",
    "choice_2": "Comparing and contrasting communism and capitalism is a complicated task, as the two systems have significant differences as well as similarities. On the whole, communism is an economic and political system in which all property is collectively owned, while capitalism is an economic system in which the means of production are privately owned. In communism the state is responsible for distributing resources and goods, while in capitalism, prices and markets are used to allocate resources. While the goal of communism is to create an egalitarian society, the goal of capitalism is to create a free market. Capitalism allows for more innovation, while communism stifles individual creativity. Both systems have been implemented across the world at different times, and both have seen both successes and failures. Ultimately, the future of both systems depends on the society that creates and maintains them.",

Additionally, if the gas is mixed with a liquid or a solid, the molecules of the gas will collide with the liquid or solid, resulting in cooling of the gas.",
    "choice_2": "Thetemperature of a gascan be decreased by increasing its pressure. This is because, as pressure increases, the collisions between the gas molecules become more violent which results in absoption of energy and a subsequent decrease in temperature.",

Despite warnings from his friends and family, Romeo recklessly pursues Juliet and they fall in love. His quick and thoughtless actions lead to their secret marriage, the death of Mercutio, and the banishment of Romeo from Verona. After his banishment, Romeo makes the fatal decision to return to Verona, despite knowing that death awaits him if he does so. Additionally, Romeo fails to consider the consequences of taking his own life and leaving Juliet alone in the world. \r\n\r\nUltimately, Romeo's rash decisions, coupled with his inability to think through the consequences of his actions, are responsible for the tragic events that take place in the end of the book.

He also used a combination of propaganda, intimidation and intimidation of opposition, and the suspension of civil liberties to consolidate his power. He also gained huge popularity by exploiting Germany\u2019s economic problems and promising a return to national pride and prosperity. Hitler also pursued an ambitious expansionist foreign policy, leading to the remilitarization of the Rhineland and the Anschluss with Austria in 1938. As the Nazi Party became the only legal political party in Germany, Hitler was able to create a totalitarian state that was ruled by fear and terror. Hitler also used the aggressive and often violent tactics of his paramilitary organization, the SS, to control the population. In addition, Hitler used his powerful oratory and propaganda to manipulate public opinion and build a cult of personality. By 1935, Hitler had secured his hold on Germany and created the totalitarian dictatorship that would lead Germany into World War II.",

In 1934, he merged the presidency with the chancellorship, allowing him to become the supreme leader of Germany. He then began to dismantle democracy, while using propaganda to gain public support. He used the emergency powers granted to him to silence his opposition, and in 1935, he declared the Enabling Act, which gave him absolute power. Through fear, propaganda, and dismantling of democracy, Adolf Hitler was able to take complete control of Germany by 1935.",

It relies on the principles of quantum mechanics, such as entanglement and superposition, to store and process information in a fundamentally different way than classical computers. In quantum computing, information is stored in qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once, allowing for the possibility of extremely powerful calculations. This allows quantum computers to solve certain problems much faster than traditional computers, making them especially useful for certain types of research and data analysis.",

Generally speaking, however, it is estimated that around 1 trillion snowflakes fall per winter, on average. This estimate is based on a number of factors, such as the length of the winter season and the number of snowfall events per season. To arrive at this estimate, scientists have studied snowfall patterns in different regions and climates over time. They have also taken into account the average size of a snowflake, as well as the approximate number of snowflakes in a single snowfall event. All of this data is then used to make an educated guess about the total number of snowflakes that fall in a typical winter season.",

This is due to the fact that snowflakes are small and fall at a rate of 1 to 2 centimeters per hour, meaning that it is difficult to make an accurate prediction of how much snow will fall in a given area. Additionally, the amount of snow that falls can be affected by weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, which can change rapidly and unpredictably.

    "choice_2": "It is difficult to accurately estimate how many snowflakes fall during a typical winter, as this number will vary depending on the location and climate. Generally speaking, however, it is estimated that around 1 trillion snowflakes fall per winter, on average. This estimate is based on a number of factors, such as the length of the winter season and the number of snowfall events per season. To arrive at this estimate, scientists have studied snowfall patterns in different regions and climates over time. They have also taken into account the average size of a snowflake, as well as the approximate number of snowflakes in a single snowfall event. All of this data is then used to make an educated guess about the total number of snowflakes that fall in a typical winter season.",
